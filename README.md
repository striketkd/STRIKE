##### This Bootstrap site was created for STRIKE Martial Arts as a token of thanks for the invaluable life lessons the coaches imparted
Perserverance, tenacity, and the ability to throw/take a (sometimes figurative) punch gets us through life, and martial arts training is a great teacher. Those same skills got this website made. 

Here are the pieces:
- StartBootstrap's beautiful starter template, [One Page Wonder](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/one-page-wonder/).
- This great example from the [Bootstrap 3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/examples/carousel/) documentation.
- The _fantastic_ [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/). It's outstanding!
- Those lovely tooltips use [Tether](http://tether.io/) with Bootstrap.
- And the buttery smooth scrolling is thanks to the [jQuery Easing Plugin](http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/).
- Everything on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 

Feel free to use, copy, modify, etc. but please respect the licenses of the plugin authors. Please don't use for evil.

This is a pro-bono project :)
